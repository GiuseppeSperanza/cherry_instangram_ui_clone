# cherryinstangramuiclone

- A simple UI instangram clone made by [Cherry Social](https://cherrysocial.it/)

## Getting Started

This project is a simple starting point for any Flutter application.
You can add whatever state management library you want using this template and changing it where you want.


We use the instagram graph api to get public info about a specific user.
To do that we use his unique instagram username.
